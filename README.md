# Minecraft Life Map

An application to be deployed to a Minecraft server that draws a map based on current region data and player locations.

This program takes the following input:
- Regular Minecraft terrain data in .mca files
- CSV files with players locations

This is going to be a part of a web page that will show current map of Świat Celejewskich minecraft server along with positions of all players.

This is a fragment of the Świat Celejewskich world depicted on that map:
