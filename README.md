# Minecraft Life Map

An application to be deployed to a Minecraft server that draws a map based on current region data and player locations.

This program takes the following input:
- Regular Minecraft terrain data in .mca files
- CSV files with players locations

This is going to be a part of a web page that will show current map of Åšwiat Celejewskich minecraft server along with positions of all players.

Result of the very, very, very early version of this program looks like this:
